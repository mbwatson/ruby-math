## Dyck

* This program is called from the command line with a positive integer argument $n$, and it returns a list of Dyck words of length $2n$.

## Goldbach

* A positive integer $m$ has a Goldbach partition if there exist two prime integers $p$ and $q$ such that $p + q = m$.
* The Goldbach Conjecture asserts that every even integer $m = 2n$, with $n > 2$, has a Goldbach partition.
*This program is called from the command line with two positive integer arguments $m$ and $n$, and it returns all Goldbach parititions $(p_k, q_k)$ for every integer $2k$, with $m \leq k \leq n$.

## Coxeter

* This one...
